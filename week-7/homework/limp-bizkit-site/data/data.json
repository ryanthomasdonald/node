        "summary" : "Three Dollar Bill, Y'all (stylized as Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$) is the debut studio album by American rap rock band Limp Bizkit, released on July 1, 1997 by Flip and Interscope Records. It established the band's trademark sound with the singles 'Counterfeit', which was influenced by hip hop and heavy metal, and 'Faith', a cover of the song of the same name by George Michael. Limp Bizkit's rearrangement of the song incorporated heavier guitar playing by Wes Borland and scratching by DJ Lethal. Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ was produced by Ross Robinson, who was introduced to the band through Korn bassist Reginald 'Fieldy' Arvizu, who persuaded Robinson to listen to Limp Bizkit's demo. Robinson was impressed by the band's motivation and sound, and agreed to work with them. The album showcased an intentionally abrasive, angry sound which the band felt would attract a fanbase.",

        "summary": "Results May Vary is the fourth studio album by American rap rock band Limp Bizkit, released on September 23, 2003, through Flip and Interscope Records. It was the band's only release under the sole-leadership of vocalist Fred Durst after the temporary departure of guitarist Wes Borland, who left in 2001. Snot guitarist Mike Smith was initially brought in to replace Borland, although the band's falling-out with Smith later led to his departure, with much of the material recorded with him being discarded from the final release. Durst and a number of guests ended up handling the majority of the album's guitar work. Upon its release, Results May Vary peaked at number 3 on the US Billboard 200, selling at least 325,000 copies in its first week of sales. While the album still eventually went platinum, both the debut and lifetime sales were still well below prior albums Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000). Results May Vary sold at least 1.3 million copies in the United States, and received mainly negative critical reception as well. Results May Vary was Limp Bizkit's last studio album released before they went on hiatus for three years, starting from 2006 to 2009.",
